# Trustpoint – Secure Digital Identities for Industry

**Trustpoint** is an open-source initiative dedicated to simplifying and securing the management of digital identities for industrial systems. As industrial environments transform into interconnected, automated, and intelligent systems, the need for robust identity and certificate management has never been more critical.

> Trustpoint was launched in Q3 2023 as part of the German federal **KMU-innovativ** initiative and is coordinated by the **Campus Schwarzwald gGmbH**. Project partners include **PrimeKey Labs GmbH**, **asvin GmbH**, **achelos GmbH**, **Hochschule Hamm-Lippstadt**, and other industrial leaders such as **ARBURG**, **Belden**, **HOMAG**, **Diebold Nixdorf**, **Schmalz**, **Siemens AG**, and **PHOENIX CONTACT**.
